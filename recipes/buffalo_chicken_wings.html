		<h3>Preparations</h3>
		<h4>Crispy Baked Wings</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking trayand let them dry uncovered in the fridge, overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.</li>

			<li>Line the tray with foil, then sprak the rack on the baking tray with oil.</li>
			<li>Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.</li>
			<li>Place the wings skin side up on the rack. Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Then move the tray up to the higher shelf, and turn the oven up to 425F. Bake for a further 40-50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned.</li>
			<li>The wings are ready when they are dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.</li>
			<li>Toss the Hot Sauce and serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks. They can be served plain, with a dipping sauce or tossed in sauce.</li>
