                        <li>Add the shrimp, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. Spread evenly across the bottom of the pot and cook until the bottoms pink and slightly brown, about 45-60 seconds. Flip and repeat until shrimp are just cooked thorugh.</li>

                        <li>Return the shrimp (and any accumulated juices) to the sauce. Add the parsley, stirring to incorporate.</li>
                        <li>Add the cooked spaghetti back into the pot, toss until evenly coated and heated, then remove from heat. Serve immediately!</li>
