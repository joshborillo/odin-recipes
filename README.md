CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THIS FAR DUDE!! Who would have known, right?

In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website (stoked?!)

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished, but it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

LET'S GET CRACKIN'!



Remember to jump back in here for a reflection piece about the project! 
See ya!
